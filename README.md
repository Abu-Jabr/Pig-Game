First, I'll like to give credits to Jonas Schmedtmann for designing this project, however, I wrote the codes 100% in completion of his Javascript Developer course.

This is a simple static DOM game that can be played by 2 players using the same device

GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GL0BAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- If a player rolls a 6 on any dice consecutively on a single turn, the player's GLOBAL score will be reset to 0
- By default, the first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
- However, the winning score can be set to any desired amount by typing in the input box below the hold button, the winning score is automatically updated and is checked after a player finishes a turn

Enjoy!
